            <h3 class="section__heading">Summary</h3>
            <p>To learn Machine Learning, you must first become a programmer. Learn programming fundamentals, how to use a code editor really well, version control and command line tooling. Get the basics down and then spend most of your time learning by tinkering. Studying theory is helpful insomuch as it can produce results. Practice what you learn to ensure that the knowledge stays, it is correct, and that you have a real use for it. The majority of your time should be spent in implementation.</p>
            <p>Focus is essential for piecing together concepts and producing something worthwhile. Minimize distractions such that you are able to direct attention purposefully to what matters most. Ensure that you get enough sleep, exercise regularly and eat healthy foods, following a time restricted eating schedule.</p>
            <p>Engage with the community. By helping others and them helping you, you exacerbate your learning process through deeper understanding and become better known. Share your work to demonstrate your expertise and knowledge. The priority is to learn, everything else is a vanity metric. Sharing your work opens it up for scrutiny by others which allows you to learn more and do better.</p>
