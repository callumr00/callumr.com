            <h3 class="content__subheading">Summary</h3>
            
            <p>The Millionaire Fastlane depicts an alternate roadmap to wealth besides being reliant on compound interest over decades. The reasoning is that you are able to more accurately and rapidly attain the life you desire, without reliance on external factors. Reliance on external factors is a base of hope, which often doesn’t come to fruition, but is realised too late to change course. Reliance on yourself and accrual of wealth while young allows you an to take increased advantage of its associated benefits, over a longer period of time.<br><br>Firstly, you must realise that wealth is not purely monetary and consists also of relationships, health and freedom—all of which are borne from an abundance of time. Next, define your goals so that your choices are already made for you—whichever gets you closer to that which you have laid out.<br><br>In order to live extraordinarily, you must willing to make extraordinary sacrifices. Delaying gratification with consistent action. Take accountability for all that occurs. Produce more than you consume; the more value you provide to society, the more value you get in return. Educate yourself continually, learning from the masters—those who have walked the path you venture onto.<br><br>Be wary of purchases for you are purchasing them with your money, a derivative of your time—to purchase something unnecessary is to spend your time fuelling the unnecessary. You want an abundance of time and to do so you much detach your income from time. Generate passive income from a self sufficient business. Generate passive income from compound interest on a large initial sum invested in appreciating assets.</p>
