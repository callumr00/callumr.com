                    <p class="content__text">While at High School, I got decent grades while having a good time and not having to try too hard. This would later set me up for difficulty when additional effort is required. Outside of school I mostly played video games for an ungodly amount of time. This is likely why I didn't try too hard; nothing interested me as much as the allure of video games. I was however especially drawn to maths and computing, over other subjects. I found that where I had innate interest and saw practical use cases I was more willing to try. I now see High School as a period of exploration and learning how to learn that sets the stage for future endeavours; while you won't need much of what you learn, it is good to know that you can learn, how to best learn, and what you are most interested in.</p>
                    <p class="content__text">After High School, I continued on to Sixth-Form studying Business, Maths, Physics, and Computing. I was so used to not having to try to hard that when the time came requiring additional study outside of school, I didn't do well. After the first year I instead went elsewhere to study a Level 3 BTEC in Games Development. The course was ok; there was a lot more theory than practicality, I would have preferred to focus more on 3D modelling and programming.</p>
                    <p class="content__text">Shortly after I finished college, in the summer of 2019, I stopped drinking. I was never a huge drinker but it had become the basis on which I would socialise with others. I realized that I had, to a degree, become reliant on alcohol's anxiety reducing effects and that if I was to continue I would become more entrenched - less capable and willing when sober.</p>
                    <p class="content__text">I was then encouraged by this to improve my wellbeing further, paying closer attention to my diet and fitness. I had never been in bad-shape and was naturally athletic but hadn't dedicated myself to a sport prior. I joined a gym and started working out consistently. Needless to say this was greatly beneficial. Frequent exercise grants many benefits, perhaps most notably are the increases in happiness, energy, and confidence in ability.</p>
                    <p class="content__text">I deleted my social media accounts around the same time.</p>
                    <p class="content__text">A few months later, in the winter of 2019, I moved to Switzerland. I stayed in a chalet in Verbier for the next few months while I trained in Skiing and Ski Instructing. I passed the BASI Alpine Level 1 exam but failed the Level 2. I had planned to resit the exam a few weeks later but had to return home; the Swiss borders were soon to be closed due to the outbreak of Covid-19.</p>
                    <p class="content__text">Once I had returned, I continued developing my skills in Game Development through 3D modelling using Blender but soon realised that it was programming that I preferred. I turned to Unity and C#. I later continued in exploration, discovering Front-End Web Development and then Data Analysis.</p>
                    <p class="content__text">Once the lockdown restrictions were eased in the start of 2021, I started a position as a Financial Claims Analyst. For a little over a year I calculated valuations on claims of financial fraud. It became an unfulfilling endeavour, so I left.</p>
                    <p class="content__text">The rise of cryptocurrency throughout 2021 afforded me the financial freedom to continue in my exploration of a career that I could devote my life towards. I entertained the possibilities of becoming a Ski Instructor, a Personal Trainer, a Photographer, a Web Developer, or a Financial Analyst. I thought it important to give chance to a large range of possibilities. In doing so, I gradually moved towards a profession with a high skill ceiling in the topics of study I most enjoyed - Maths, Software Engineering, and Philosophy.</p>
                    <p class="content__text">I became aware of AI when everyone else did, when ChatGPT was released in the winter of 2022. I became fascinated by the technology, soon realised it was at the intersection of these topics, and so began studying Machine Learning.</p>
                    <p class="content__text">However, this was not before I travelled along the 'shitcoin horseshoe' in which I would become first a proponent of Bitcoin, then various Altcoins, before returning to solely Bitcoin. I am now however a Crypto Sceptic, as the adoption and potential use cases of even Bitcoin seem to be largely overblown.</p>
                    <p class="content__text">Early in 2023 I was encountering diminishing returns in weighlifting. Throughout the lockdown period, when gyms were closed, I did calisthenics at home. I would then renew my membership once restrictions were eased and they reopened. At this point I had been working out for around 3 years and the lack of progression was hindering my enjoyment of the sport. I had wanted to start training in martial arts and was intrigued by Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, so I signed up and have been training that primarily since, with some supplementary weightlifting.</p>
                    <p class="content__text">While studying, in the summer of 2023, I sought to further reclaim my attention and have since deleted my accounts on most remaining feed-generating apps and video game platforms. From this has come increased mental clarity and peace. Following this success I upgraded my iPhone X smartphone to a Nokia 2660 Flip - a dumbphone with little more than the ability to make calls and texts.</p>
                    <p class="content__text">Throughout this time I have travelled a lot. However, I recently found that I desire the level of mastery in craft that can only be achieved when stationary (as this grants enhanced focus). As such, travel is now a rarity.</p>
