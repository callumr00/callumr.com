			<h2>Values and Personal Philosophy</h2>
			<p>I aim to serve others through provision and protection.</p>
			<p>With this in mind, I explore to uncover challenges. For challenges facilitate growth and growth means I am better able to serve.</p>
			<p>In doing all I can for those around me, and accepting that which is out of my control, I am rewarded with peace of mind.</p>
			<p>Through this peace, I can presently experience the beauty of life - the absurdity of the infinite complexity that aggregates to form our reality.</p>
			<h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2>
			<p>In a primary interest I seek mastery through continued engagement:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Programming &amp; Technology</li>
			</ol>
			<p>In secondary interests I seek excellence through frequent engagement:</p>
			<ol start="2">
				<li>Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, Philosophy</li>
			</ol>
			<p>In tertiary interests I seek casual enjoyment through occasional engagement:</p>
			<ol start="3">
				<li>Art, Bouldering, Chess, Hiking, Photography, Skiing, Writing</li>
			</ol>
