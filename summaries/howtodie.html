                    <h2 class="content__heading">Summary</h2>
                    <p class="content__text">Death is a necessity in life and is inescapable. Through avoidance of this certainty comes frustration and fear, lessening the quality of your life. By pondering death and accepting that it will be upon you soon enough, you can focus your action on what matters most. You are able to live life unhindered by its associated fear.</p>
                    <p class="content__text">In avoidance of death you succumb to regret, for you don’t truly live. In renouncement of death you succumb to foolishness, for you seek to change nature.</p>
                    <p class="content__text">The finiteness of life is what fosters beauty. Nothing can be beautiful if it is eternal. Each moment is fleeting, to be experienced once and then never again. You are graced with these moments, but when met with death, you seek more. For what reason? Did you waste those that have passed? Would you not continue to waste them if you were granted extension?</p>
                    <p class="content__text">To die well is to have lived well and prepared for death through life. Ensure presence in each moment, so that when you are greeted by death you can say you have truly lived and that this is just the natural next step.</p>
