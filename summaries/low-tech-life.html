			<h2>Summary</h2>
			<p>In order to lead the life in which we aspire to, we must be aware of the impact of smartphones. This is because of their use being a large portion of our waking hours. While enabling engagement with many wondrous activities through the recent surge in capability, developers have taken advantage of the human psyche to addict the individual such that the majority of time spent serves no purpose.</p>
			<p>It is then important to break this addiction to mindless consumption and act with increased intentionality in the pursuit of fulfillment. The devices themselves are increasingly enticing due to the beautiful design and large, vivid screens. An alternative is the dumbphone, think more towards a phone from 2010, with limited capability and questionable design.</p>
			<p>A dumbphone is limited in it's ability, offering only what is essential. Capabilities are ranged among the offerings and their use is largely driven by those wanting respite from the constant barrage of attention-sapping notifications. The switching from a smartphone to a dumbphone is an optimization for focus, opting for less distraction and more mindfulness such that the individual can lead a more fulfilling and capable life.</p>

					<p>By limiting the available features, dumbphones enable users to focus on what truly matters in their lives, fostering a healthier relationship with technology.
