                    <h2 class="content__heading">Summary</h2>
                    <p class="content__text">The Four Hour Work Week is about defining your goals and making action towards them. Maximise productivity by trimming the excess and focusing on what has the highest value output. Free your time by detaching it from income so that you are able to lead the life you desire without restraint.</p>
                    <p class="content__text">It defines the process of Definition (Define your wants) → Elimination (Remove that which is unnecessary) → Automation (Create a self sufficient, revenue generating machine) → Liberation.</p>
                    <p class="content__text">Identify that which is most beneficial so that you can give it complete focus, disregarding the rest. By limiting the activities you engage in and the people you associate with, you can spend more time with what matters most. This produces the best overall results.</p>
