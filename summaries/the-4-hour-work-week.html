			<h2>Summary</h2>
			<p>The Four Hour Work Week is about defining your goals and making action towards them. Maximise productivity by trimming the excess and focusing on what has the highest value output. Free your time by detaching it from income so that you are able to lead the life you desire without restraint.</p>
			<p>It defines the process of Definition (Define your wants) → Elimination (Remove that which is unnecessary) → Automation (Create a self sufficient, revenue generating machine) → Liberation.</p>
			<p>Identify that which is most beneficial so that you can give it complete focus, disregarding the rest. By limiting the activities you engage in and the people you associate with, you can spend more time with what matters most. This produces the best overall results.</p>
			<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>Define your goals and what your dream life would look like, so that you have a grasp of what you’re aiming for.</li>
				<li>Play to your strengths and maximise any inherent advantages.</li>
				<li>Focus on being productive and not being busy; focus your time on higher value tasks and eliminate or outsource everything else.</li>
				<li>Batch similar tasks together to limit setup cost and manage their frequency.</li>
				<li>Look towards your interests and knowledge base for organic business ideas, where you are aware of a problem and would yourself benefit from its creation, as you are then certain that there is a need to be filled.</li>
				<li>Make a business that is self sufficient, so that you are able to provide value to the world with minimal time input, affording you the time to pursue whatever you desire.</li>
			</ol>

					<p>What information consumes is rather obvious: it consumes the attention of it’s recipients. Hence, a wealth of information creates a poverty of attention and a need to allocate that attention efficiently among the overabundance of information sources that might consume it.</p>

					<p>All courses of action are risky, so prudence is not in avoiding danger (it’s impossible), but calculating risk and acting decisively. Make mistakes of ambition and not mistakes of sloth. Develop the strength to do bold things, not the strength to suffer.</p>
