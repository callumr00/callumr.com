                    <p class="content__text">To work effectively, you must know in what conditions of work you are most suited to. Identify your strengths and play to them, seeking to improve them and engaging in situations where they can be best utilised. You must know how you best perform; how you can most effectively learn, produce results and what role you are most suited to. Find your values and convey them to those you work with, engaging in environments that hold similar values.</p>
                    <p class="content__text">Examine situations based on what you are able to offer, give your traits, and how best you can make an impact. Take responsibility for gaining and sharing this knowledge of how you best perform so that others are able to adhere to it and collaborate in ways they best perform.</p>
