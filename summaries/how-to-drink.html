			<h2>Summary</h2>
			<p>How To Drink details the pros and cons of alcohol and how to make the most of it should you choose to partake. The only viable reasoning for partaking is for your own enjoyment. You must be selective of who you choose to associate with as they will dictate the path of both the experience and, over a long enough time frame, your life. Engage in the festivities and become a joy to be around; humour people in their interests, be polite and easygoing, and know your limitations and stay below them—ensure sound functioning of the body and mind.</p>
			<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>Don’t drink for the sake of others, but yourself and personal enjoyment.</li>
				<li>Associate with those that are beneficial to your life and the life you wish to lead.</li>
				<li>Embrace the moment and make it as enjoyable as possible for you and your peers.</li>
				<li>Know your limitations and stay within them.</li>
			</ol>
