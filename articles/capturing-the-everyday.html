			<h2>An Effort to Create and Preserve Memories</h2>
			<p>I originally got a camera in an effort to both create and preserve memories as a hobbyist photographer under the premise that I would be more inclined to seek out beauty in my current surroundings and to seek variety in further surroundings.</p>
			<p>The camera, a Fujifilm X-T3 with a Fujifilm XF 18-55mm F2.8-4 R LM OIS kit lens, creates wonderfully accurate images and is well suited to the task at hand.</p>
			<p>But this was 3 years ago, and my usage has been in decline since. I usually only take it out when travelling and expecting picturesque landscapes; the big things. It is otherwise too cumbersome or out of place, even with just a mid-sized lens.</p>
			<p>In doing so, I miss the small, unexpected scenes I come across every day and limit the creation and preservation of memories in this manner to events that would likely be preserved in memory regardless.</p>
			<p>The goal, then, is to pay more attention to the small things, by way of seeking beauty for capture in an image, such that I am more attentive to my surroundings, and thus grow more appreciative of their current form and fleeting nature.</p>
			<p>In this way, you are also given more opportunity to iterate and progress in the pursuit of mastery; through taking more photos, you have more to learn from, each slowly developing your style and expertise.</p>

			<p>On realising this, I sought a more compact lens, one less cumbersome and more attuned to everyday environments, such that I would be more likely to carry around and use it in this way.</p>
			<p>It could be argued that this is more suitable for that of a phone, but I think a dedicated camera is often more intentional. That, and the camera on my Nokia 2660 Flip isn't that good.</p>
			<p>I landed on the Fujifilm XF 27mm F2.8 R WR. Coming in at just 33% of the length and 27% of the weight of the aforementioned kit lens, this is a much more discrete and portable option while still retaining capability for high quality images.</p>
