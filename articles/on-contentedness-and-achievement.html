			<h2>Direction</h2>
			<p>It's always helpful to have a desired future state in mind, however vague. It gives guidance to your direction. You'll otherwise be wandering aimlessly, with your final destination a product of pure chance. Of course, there's no escaping chance, but through intention you can guide yourself towards a more tailored fate, if you so wish.</p>
			<p>You may want something highly tailored - a concrete, greatly specific future state - for which you will continually march in a singular direction. I like to leave myself some room, with intentionally vague direction that allows for exploration.</p>
			<h2>Contentedness</h2>
			<p>Still, I try not to focus too much on this future state - what I could have or where I could be. I find it's difficult to be content with what I have now when I'm inundated with the comparative discrepencies. I won't get to where I'd like to be as quickly if I slow down for rest, appreciation, or exploration, but it's good for my current wellbeing; it's rejuvenating.</p>
			<h2>Achievement</h2>
			<p>But I still want to get there. Contentedness with one's lot and a want for achieving something greater seem to be opposing objectives. Does a want for more not inherently mean current dissatisfaction? How can a balance be struck such that I am content but still able to achieve?</p>
			<p>I believe the key is in becoming interested with that which leads to achievement, rather than suffering through it, and then simply repeatedly engaging with that which you find interesting. By engaging with these interests, you will inevitably reach greater heights through the accumulation of experience - even if your goal was merely present engagement.</p>
			<p>In the short term you won't get as far as you otherwise would prioritising achievement at all costs. You may in the long term, as the aforementioned rest, appreciation, and exploration are likely to increase your longevity in this pursuit. But you also may never.</p>
			<p>Does it matter? Does absolute advancement win out over your current wellbeing and the enjoyment of the pursuit?</p>
