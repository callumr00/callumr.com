# About This Website

*This a [colophon](https://indieweb.org/colophon) page.*

## Ethos

I deleted my social media accounts in the pursuit of [Reclaiming Attention](http://callumr.com/articles/attention). Instead, this website serves as my presence on the internet.

The maintenance of this website is largely a hobby and I don't expect visitors. Though it's still important to me that I keep things simple and take a user-centric approach, opting for function over form.

In keeping with not expecting any visitors, any writing is for purely selfish reasons. I write with the intent of helping me distill my thoughts and solidify ideas. But still, I hope others can benefit from what I share.

## Technology

This website is fully hand-coded, using HTML, SCSS, and a little bit of vanilla Javascript.

I've hand-coded it all because it's been fun to do so, and it keeps everything nice and tidy if anyone wants to inspect the page to view style rules or trial changes.

I've used SCSS because it feels nicer to use than standard CSS. You can have a cleaner structure in your code. It gets compiled down to CSS anyway, but makes tweaking things a bit easier.

I've used vanilla Javascript because there is too much overhead with anything else. This site is only simple, and so it doesn't make sense to introduce such complexity. It also makes sure there isn't much to download for any visitors.

## Typography

I've tried to optimise for readability and, while I love the look of a smaller (14px) font size and/or a monospace font, it's a little harder to read. So I use a regular (16px) size and [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/).

Though, I still use [Roboto Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Mono) where I want a consistent width. An example of which is in the activity feed items on the home page, for the category and timestamp for each item.

## Tracking

No tracking! I have absolutely no interest or use for your data - keep it!

## Hosting

This website is hosted using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). It's just very convenient, with the [source](https://github.com/callumr00/callumr.com) being an open Github repository already.

I've had the domain for a few years now. Originally from [Google Domains](https://domains.google.com/), but they have since sold to [Squarespace](https://domains.squarespace.com/).
