			<h2>I Want to Find My Natural Pace</h2>
			<h2>I Want to be a Software Engineer</h2>
			<p>I have such an intense fascination with Programming &amp; Technology. I'm greatly interested in the inner machinations of computers, their capability for huge societal impact, and the philosophical implications of this. The potential from harnessing their power is so inconceivably grand, and increasingly so.</p>
			<p>I want Software Engineering to be my craft, and to seek mastery of craft such that I can, with time, learn to harness some of this power. Largely for my personal intellectual satiety.</p>
			<h2>I Want to Start A Family</h2>
			<p>Perhaps in my mid-30s, when my capability as a provider in all facets is sufficiently advanced to be able to provide a good quality of life, I'd like to have a couple of children with someone whom I'd like to spend the rest of my life with.
			<h2>I Want to Design My Own House</h2>
			<p>There's just something greatly enticing about the presence of my home, both interior and exterior, being largely of my own conception.</p>
			<p>I love Scandinavian minimalism, of which <a href="https://normcph.com/project_category/residential/" target="_blank">Norm Architects</a> seems to be the embodiment - lots of natural light, natural materials, natural colours, and space to breathe. In particular, I like their <a href="https://normcph.com/project/skovshoved-residence/" target="_blank">Skovshoved Residence</a>.</p>
			<p>Similarly, I like <a href="https://www.standardarchitecture.com/work/forest-knoll" target="_blank">Standard Architecture's Forest Knoll</a>. But I find it's a bit too grandiose for my tastes (and, at a $22M valuation, my wallet!). I want something small, with minimal required maintenance. I want a sauna and a home gym, but I'd rather do without the cinema, swimming pool, 2nd living room, and 2nd garage.</p>
			<p>I'm also drawn to the prospect of being surrounded by nature, however inconvenient. Something like <a href="https://www.lookingglasslodge.co.uk/" target="_blank">Looking Glass Lodge</a>.</p>
