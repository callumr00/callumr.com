			<h2>1. I Want to Find My Natural Pace</h2>
			<h2>2. I Want to be a Software Engineer</h2>
			<p>And then on to pursuing Software Engineering mastery.</p>
			<h2>3. I Want to Start A Family</h2>
			<p>In my mid-30s, when I'm sufficiently advanced in my career that I am able to financially provide a good quality of life, I'd like to have 2 or 3 children with someone whom I'd like to spend the rest of my life with (1 seems too few, and 4 seems too many).
			<p>But not just financial provision, of course.</p>
			<p>I want to be able to support their emotional needs as well. I want to be someone who my children can admire and respect. I want to be able to sufficiently guide and inspire them when they inevitably become lost.</p>
			<p>And I hope to give the same to my life partner, whoever that may turn out to be.</p>
			<p></p>
			<h2>4. I Want to Design My Own House</h2>
			<p>I love Scandinavian Minimalism, of which <a href="https://normcph.com/project_category/residential/" target="_blank">Norm Architects</a> seems to be the embodiment - lots of natural light, natural materials, natural colours, and space to breathe.</p>
			<p>In particular, I like their <a href="https://normcph.com/project/skovshoved-residence/" target="_blank">Skovshoved Residence</a>:</p>

			<p>Similarly, I like <a href="https://www.standardarchitecture.com/work/forest-knoll" target="_blank">Standard Architecture's Forest Knoll</a>:<p>
			<img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/542032d5e4b0968055ce5118/1592090210028-9IWGF9KD16O6PQD1XE3I/Forest+Knoll?format=2500w">
			<img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/542032d5e4b0968055ce5118/1592092768890-OFHZ1JXF626ITCR2FJER/Forest+Knoll?format=1500w">
			<p>But I find it's a bit too grandiose for my tastes (and, at a $22M valuation, my wallet!). I want something small, but big enough. I don't want to have to spend all my free time on maintenance. I want a sauna and a home gym, but I'd rather do without the cinema, swimming pool, 2nd living room, and 2nd garage.</p>
			<p>Though, I also find the prospect of being surrounded by nature enticing, however inconvenient. Something like <a href="https://www.lookingglasslodge.co.uk/" target="_blank">Looking Glass Lodge</a>:</p>

			<p>At some point I'll boot up <a href="https://www.blender.org/" target="_blank">Blender</a>, or learn some architecture software, and play around.</p>
