			<h2>A Note on Goalsetting</h2>
			<p>It's always helpful to have future aspirations in mind, for they give guidance to your direction.</p>
			<p>But I try to not focus too much on what I could have in the future, as I find it makes it difficult to be content with what I have now. This striving may lead to greater achievement, but it would be at the cost of current wellbeing.</p>
			<p>As with most everything, there is a balance to be struck. I want to be content, but I also want to achieve. How, then, do I go about finding this balance?</p>
			<p>I believe the key is in becoming interested with that which leads to achievement, rather than suffering through it, and then simply repeatedly engaging with that which you find interesting.</p>
			<p>By engaging with these interests, you will inevitably reach greater heights through the accumulation of experience - even if your goal was merely engagement.</p>
			<p>It's also important to take time to reflect on your progress and to appreciate what you have now, as it can often be taken for granted while we are swept away down life's many winding paths.</p>
